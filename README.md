**CDT-JS** is a web interface for generating constrained Delaunay triangulations of 2D points, written in JavaScript.

### How to use

1. Insert a set of 2D points to triangulate.
  * **Random:** A random distribution of points may be added by entering the required number of points and clicking the "*Generate random vertices*" button. The points can be sampled from a uniform or standard normal distribution.
  * **Import from file:** Points may also be imported from a file using the button under "*Load vertices from file*". The x and y coordinates of each point should be space- or comma-separated, and each point should exist on its own line.
  * **Manual entry:**
